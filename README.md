# IMU & GPS & LIDAR localization

## Using ESKF to fuse IMU and GPS and LIDAR data to achieve global localization.

gps data only for initialization and correction when lidar matching pose is poor.

### The code is implemented base on the book "Quaterniond kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter"
